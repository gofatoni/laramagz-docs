== Number of Nested Comments

You can set the number of comment reply level depths so that comment replies at the last number of levels cannot be replied to.

Example: If you set the value to 3 then the number of nesting levels is only 3 comment replies. You cannot add another reply to the last comment.

== Receive Comment Response Emails

When you activate sending comment replies to email, you will receive a reply to the comment via email.

Requirements:

- Configure email in .env:
+
```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.googlemail.com
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_USERNAME=your@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=y0urP4s5w0rd
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME=Yourname
```
+
- Make sure the email you enter in the comment form is a real email so you can receive a reply.

[CAUTION]
====
When sending email replies to comments is activated, the process of replying to comments will take longer because the email sending process occurs. Even though it supports the use of queues so that processes run in the background, it is difficult to do on shared hosting. 

So, the "send comment replies to email" feature is not recommended to enable on shared hosting, unless you have no problem with longer processing times.
