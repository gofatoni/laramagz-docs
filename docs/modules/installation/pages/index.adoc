[#instruction]
== The root home directory is not public_html

For example, the name of your root folder is `httpdocs`, then you have to adjust the env file as follows:

```
ROOT_PUBLIC=/../../httpdocs
```

You should also modify the file `laramagz/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` on lines 33 - 35. Change `public_html` to `httpdocs`

```php
$this->app->bind('path.public', function() {
    return base_path().'/../httpdocs';
});
```
