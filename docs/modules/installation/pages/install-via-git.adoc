Enter the laramagz folder that has been successfully cloned.

1. Upload all files and folders in laramagz public storage (`storage/app/public`) into laramagz `storage/app/public` on hosting.

Exit the laramagz folder and then delete the root home directory or `public_html`. 

Type `pwd` to find out the path to your current directory location, for example you are currently in the directory path `/home/u778899/`.

Run the symlink command to link laramagz's `public` folder to `public_html` or root home directory.
