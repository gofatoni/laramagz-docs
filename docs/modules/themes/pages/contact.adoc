The title of the contact page can be made multi-language, also with a URL that can be customized according to the language used.

For URLs it is recommended not to add anything in front of the delimiter (/) or after the slug (contact/) because it could result in the page not being found.

== Contact information

If contact information is disabled, it will remove the contact information section so that the contact form display will be in the middle of the page.
